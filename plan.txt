1. Web Scraping Logic:
Scrape the data portal website. 
Core of API, fetching real-time data from the source. 
Should be optimized to handle the structure of the data portal efficiently.

2. API Endpoint Creation:
Develop API endpoints that execute the scraping script. 
Endpoints will take user requests, scrape the necessary data, then return it in a structured format like JSON.

3.Handle Requests and Responses:
Ensure API can accept parameters from user requests (like specific tags or dataset names) 
and use them in the scraping logic to filter or search for specific datasets.

4. Error Handling and Validation: 
Implement robust error handling to manage issues like network errors, 
changes in the source websiteâ€™s structure, or empty responses.

5. Optimization:
Optimize your script for performance and reliability.
This might include improving the parsing logic, handling exceptions, and managing timeouts.

6. Integration and Testing:
Integrate this script with your web server framework (like Flask or Django for Python)
and thoroughly test the endpoints to ensure they return accurate and up-to-date data.

7. Create CRON jobs


2 - API Endpoint Creation detail:

    a) Choose a Database:

        Select a database that suits your needs. Common choices include PostgreSQL, MySQL, 
        or SQLite. Make sure the database server is set up and running on your server.

    b) Create a Database Table:

        Define a table structure to store information about the datasets. This table should include 
        columns such as dataset name, topic, link, etc.

    c) Insert Data into the Database:

        Write a script or use a tool to insert the existing datasets into the database. You can automate 
        this process based on the dataset information you already have.

    d) Create FastAPI Endpoints:

        Build FastAPI endpoints to fetch specific datasets from the database. The API should connect to 
        the database, execute queries, and return the requested data.

    e) Deploy the FastAPI App:

        Deploy the FastAPI application on your server. You can use ASGI servers like Uvicorn or Hypercorn 
        to run your FastAPI app.

    f) Secure the API:

        Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to your API. This ensures 
        that only authorized users can fetch datasets.
